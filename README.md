Hey there!

This is a quick rundown of the poster I created for my "The Rice Spot" project.

Objective:
The main goal was to design a cool digital poster that would make people want to order some fried rice. I wanted it to be eye-catching and clear about what's being sold.

Steps:

Idea: I decided on a friendly, bold style and a chef-in-action theme to make the food look fresh.

Design: I played with a split layout—text on one side, a big picture on the other—to keep it simple and easy to read.

Colors: I chose a high-contrast palette with a pop of orange to make the "ORDER NOW" button really stand out.

Tools Used:
I used a graphic design tool like Canva for everything from layout to the final image.

Outcome:
The finished poster looks professional and does its job well. It's a great example of using design to grab attention and get a message across!
