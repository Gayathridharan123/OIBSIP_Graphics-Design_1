My "The Rice Spot" Poster Project
Hey there!

This is where I've put the digital poster I designed for a made-up brand called "The Rice Spot." It was a fun little project to practice making an ad that looks good and gets a clear message across.

My main goal was pretty simple: make a poster that would make someone instantly want to eat fried rice! I tried to do this by:

Using a cool picture: I found this awesome illustration of a chef cooking, which makes the food look fresh and exciting.

Making it pop: The bright orange color is there for a reasonâ€”it grabs your attention and really highlights the "ORDER NOW" button.

Keeping it simple: I split the poster so the words are on one side and the main picture is on the other. It's easy to read and understand at a glance.

I made this using a tool like Canva. It was a great way to learn about using colors and layouts to create a professional-looking ad.
